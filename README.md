# Processing-Time-Allocation-using-Auctions
## A multiagent Systems project on Implementation of Second price type and First price type(when only one resource is auctioned at a time) auction based allocation scheme for the following scenario
On a computer server, the number of computation slots available for the next time interval is a random number with a binomial distribution with n and p=1/2. There are 20 agents who want to schedule their jobs, where each has a job available for the next time slot with probability 0.5 and with a valuation that is randomly drawn from a uniform distribution between 0 and 1 (each job needs exactly 1 resource slot). Each job can only be scheduled during the next time slot or its utility drops to 0. Every agent and the auctioneer know how many of the agents submit bids (i.e. how many of them have a job available) and how many resource slots are available.
